I got the dataset from kaggle and would love to share some intresting things which I did this time   
I wrote a python script calling a recursive function to write PDF pages for me. The script does intresting things - it reads data from DF/file and retrives rows of country names, computes certain numerical parameters and writes them to a new pdf page - all automatically written (Hail Python!)

You can check out the the dashboard at https://www.novypro.com/project/tourism-dashboard. 
The total value for tourism has also been forecasted with PBI analytics at 99% confidence interval, not ignoring the fall in revenue due to covid.  
Also, some countries were not processed due to errors in country names - I could have manually corrected the names but I wanted to do it through scripting which I wasn't able to do - I have enlisted the unprocessed country names at the end of the PDF - but their analytics have also been processed in PowerBI
